# *Botryllus schlosseri* Nickel Toxicity

## Background

Nickel toxicity has never been characterized in *B. schlosseri*. Here we perform several experments evaluating nickel impacts on the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of this marine tunicate. We also establish the LC50 of this species.

## Objectives 

a)  Evaluate the impact of nickel on expression of genes relating to oxidative stress, senescence, stemness, and apoptosis.

b)  Determine LC50.
